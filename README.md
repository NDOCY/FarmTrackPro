# üåæ FarmTrack Pro  
### Smart Farm Management & E-Commerce System  

FarmTrack Pro is a comprehensive web-based farm management system developed in ASP.NET MVC (Entity Framework, SQL Server).  
It provides an end-to-end solution for managing agricultural operations, workforce activities, livestock records, inventory, crop lifecycles, and an integrated e-commerce marketplace for farm products.

## üöÄ Project Overview

FarmTrack Pro was developed in two major increments across the academic year:

### **Increment 1 ‚Äì Core Farm Management**
Focused on digitizing internal farm operations and human resource workflows:
- **Job Applications Module:** Admins post vacancies for various farm departments (e.g., crop management, livestock, logistics).  
  Employees and registered users can apply directly through the system.  
- **Farm Tasks Module:** Enables admins to assign **recurring or one-time tasks** to employees or entire departments.  
  Supports task scheduling, progress tracking, and completion logging.  
- **Inventory Management:**  
  Tracks all farm inputs and tools, including fertilizers, seeds, and equipment.  
  - Logs **usage and restocking**.  
  - Integrates with **supplier lists** to automatically generate restock requests when stock reaches a threshold.  
- **Livestock Management:**  
  Records both purchased and newborn livestock.  
  Tracks health metrics, weight, vaccination schedules, and reproduction methods (natural or artificial insemination).  
- **Equipment Records:**  
  Manages tractors, irrigation pumps, and other farm machinery‚Äîcovering usage logs, maintenance schedules, and performance status.

### **Increment 2 ‚Äì Crop Management, Mapping & E-Commerce**
Expanded functionality to include crop lifecycle tracking and an integrated sales platform:
- **Plot & Crop Management:**  
  - Assign crops to specific plots with detailed soil, seed, and growth information.  
  - Interactive **map view** for plot visualization.  
  - Tracks entire **crop lifecycle** from soil preparation to harvesting.  
- **PlotCrop Lifecycle Dashboard:**  
  - Monitors key farming operations (weeding, fertilization, pest control, irrigation, harvesting).  
  - Includes **Activity Log** for field events like pest sightings, fertilizer applications, or growth measurements.
- **E-Commerce Integration:**  
  The farm can now directly sell products online via the built-in store.  
  - **Products** sourced from livestock, crops, or inventory.  
  - **Discount Vouchers** with fixed or percentage-based discounts.  
  - **Shopping Cart & Checkout** with real-time validation and stock synchronization.  
  - **Delivery Tracking** using a **unique delivery verification code** system.  
  - **Customer Reviews** restricted to **verified buyers**.  
  - **Sales Analytics** providing insights into top-selling products, voucher redemptions, and total revenue trends.
